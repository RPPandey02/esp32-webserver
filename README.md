# ESP32-Based Web Server

## Overview
This project implements a simple web server using the ESP32 microcontroller. The web server serves a basic webpage that can be accessed from a web browser. This project is a great starting point for IoT applications that require a web interface.

## Features
- Web server running on the ESP32 microcontroller
- Basic webpage served to clients accessing the ESP32's IP address
- Easily customizable webpage content and functionality

## Requirements
- ESP32 development board
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- ESP32 board support package installed in the IDE
- USB cable for programming and powering the ESP32

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
3. Connect your ESP32 development board to your computer using a USB cable.
4. Select the appropriate board and port in the IDE.
5. Upload the code to the ESP32.
6. Open a web browser and enter the IP address of the ESP32 to view the webpage.

## Usage
- Customize the webpage by modifying the HTML code in the `index.html` file.
- Modify the server behavior by editing the Arduino code in the `ESP32_Web_Server.ino` file.
